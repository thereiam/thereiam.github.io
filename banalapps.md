### BanalApps
#### Encryptator

I created an Android application to secure your data using symmetric encryption algorithms.

The application leverages AES/GCM and ChaCha20/Poly1305 to encrypt the data.

Argon2Id, SCrypt, and PBKDF2 are used to create a derived key from a user-provided password.

The application is still in Closed Testing.

If you want to test it, please join the following [Google Group](https://groups.google.com/g/testers-community), which will allow you to see and install the application from Google Play Store.
