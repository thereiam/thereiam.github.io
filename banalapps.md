# BanalApps

I created an Android application to secure your data using symmetric encryption algorithms.

The application leverages AES/GCM and ChaChaPoly1305 to encrypt the data.

Argon2Id, SCrypt, and PBKDF2 are used to create a derived key from a user-provided password.

The application is still in Closed Testing. If you want to try it, please join the following Google Group, which will allow you to see and install the application.
