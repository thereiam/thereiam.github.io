# Welcome to my Github Page

Hello! I'm a tech enthusiast and **IT Security Engineer** based in **Luxembourg**.

A personal project I have been working on since some time now is **Encryptator**, an Android application to perform symmetric encryption operations.

Don't hesitate to read the details [here](https://banalapps.github.io/) if you would like to test it.
