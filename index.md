# Welcome to my personal page

Hello! I'm a tech enthusiast and **IT Security Engineer** based in **Luxembourg**.

A personal project I have been working on since some time now is [Encryptator](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=lu.monks.banalapps.encryptator), an Android application to secure your data using symmetric encryption algorithms.

Don't hesitate to read the details [here](https://banalapps.monks.lu/) if you would like to test it.
