# About Me

Hi, I'm **John Doe**! I'm a full-stack developer based in New York City. I specialize in creating beautiful and functional websites and applications.

I have experience working with technologies like:

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Vue.js
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express, Python, Django
- **Databases**: MongoDB, MySQL, PostgreSQL

I love coding and am always excited to learn new things. When I'm not coding, you can find me reading tech blogs, playing video games, or hiking.
